        FRAGMENTED: August 2022-November 2024
    </h2>
    <p>
        As I learned more and more about storytelling and about the people who go to make spectacular animated films, I found myself in need of a universal experience that I could capture and share. That experience became mourning; mourning childhood to be more precise. I felt that everyone had some motiff they had grieve, a house, a school, Grandparents, their parents marraige. The grief I was handed was the death of a childhood friend. This project escalated into me spending months digesting a death that occured years ago, and I wanted to understand why it was so impactful now.

        I began to realize that this friendship was a huge source of nutruring back when I was 8-11 years old. I was the eldest daughter, my mom juggled jobs housework, schooling; my only sibling was 7 years younger than me. From a very young age I was the household support. Not when I was with the Dowe sisters, there were four of them, two of us. Together we made a squadron of six girls, ranging from 4-14 years old. And Tatiana and I were leading the batallion. It was chaotic, loud, boundary-asserting and so, so so overwhelming. But I had a support; I had somone to help me make 8 grilled cheese sandwhiches, someone who taught me clever ways to go about chores, play card games, express interests. I felt grounded in girlhood, I could enjoy childhood whimsy, it was really fucking awesome.
        And then I didn't see her for a few years, we met briefly in middle school, everything was comfortable and natural. Then a few more years passed, and she died. I didn't feel much of anything when I recieved the news. After some time however, I realized I couldn't peel a tangerine or say "cellular phone" without thinking of her.

    <h2> The Squawk Project: Spring 2023</h2>
    <p>
        My first offical animation program at Evergreen was this awesome class taught by a guest faculty. Charmingly dubbed "Art Time" we spent 6 months learning various ways to animate (exclusively using accessible means may I add) half way through we were given the task of a final project.
        I chose to embrace my awkward mode of stress relief: dance.

<p>
    Part of my prep for this project was making three graphs, all mapping my experiences from age 9-20 ​

    <br> One for how often I danced or rollerskated

    <br> One for how stressed I was during that time,

    <br> And one for my self confidence.


    <br> The first two were perfect mirrors of each other, with high stress starting in 8th grade, peaking in 10th grade, being a constant throughout the rest of high school, subsiding for a bit as college started and peaking once again this last summer and staying there. And dance became something to lean on in those (these) crazy times. I never really had any curiosity in substance use but my god, "dancing" in the dark or going to punk shows have given me all the highs I've needed. It's fantastic, ​


I was enrolled into dance classes in early elementary, ballet, tap and modern. Financial hardships came and my mom said I had to choose ONE extra-curricular, I chose to stick with my bowling league. And I began to regret that decision in high school when looking at a couple of my good friends that had stayed in dance. They had excellent bodies; they were fit and beautiful and strong (and their only responsibility outside of school was dance/cheer). I wanted that, I wanted to be good at it too, I took it very seriously. ​

But now I've gotten to a point where I am so relieved that I wasn't in their position. It's something I can do without the pressure of being "good at it"​

A small part of me still wants that fitness and beautiful body- but mainly just gaining that muscle so I can groove on my roller skates  more effectively (my biggest and stupidest falls have been from me not having the skill capacity to boogie as hard as I want) ​

    I really don't appreciate how awkward I am, I can't speak eloquently, my handwriting is that of a 12-year-old boy, I'm clumsy, and have no spatial awareness. I've been doing customer service for years, asking the same questions, sticking to the same script and I STILL mess up and cringe at some interactions. And don't get me started at interacting with people my age. ANYWAY. For as long as I remember, I've been told remedies to all these things. I was given things to practice, and I did them under the guise that this awkwardness isn't universal (it most certainly is !)

    The precious thing about being awkward is that you're allowing yourself to just Be. You're allowed to make weird, stupid and messy art, you can make interactions that you would be too nervous for, and it all comes down to just accepting that shit happens, and you can't pin yourself to the Ideal and think you'll enjoy it. And dance is certainly the safest space for me to exercise this idea. It's not really relevant anymore, but growing up with hip-hop being the highlight of pop culture, I was pressured into thinking I had to dance well and promiscuous enough because I 'm brown and that was the expectation. (You know the jokes about white people not being able to dance). And although that isn't really an idea anymore (neither is clubbing as far as I know) I still felt the relief when I just stopped caring. I let myself dance as white as I could, I embraced my stupid pop punk and I have been having a great time ever since.

        This work began in December of 2023, when I had to schedule the removal of my wisdom teeth at the poor people clinic. They prefaced that the surgery would be done without anesthesia or laughy gas. It would be me, a good amount of numbing shots, and a doctor using brute force to remove my fully grown teeth. I talked to some classmates and joked that I was going to make it a performance piece, they laughed and imagined seeing it as a Live Story on Instagram. I sat on it and wrote. 
        And wrote a lot. 
        Ideas of mother/daughter relationships came up, by means of jealousy, vanity. Ideas of violent cosmetics came up, I wanted to emphasize that a lot of the beauty regimens women are upheld to call for violent, intrusive procedures; beauty is pain. Notions of "intimacy" and the relationship of patient and dentist came up. Ideal versus Real, inner dialogs and outter stresses, psychological terror. Teeth became a very rich topic to think about.
        Ultimately, this project has become a declaration of helplessness, and then navigating how to gain control.

    <p>
        You can read the work as it is currently in my blog. Hopefully this project takes form as a short animated film.
